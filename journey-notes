Had intellij issues

Defining endpoint with the correct parameters was easy

But modelMapper sometimes set tags to null

Had not user modelMapper so tried to get that to work
configuring modelMapper for post did not work because it's a closed class
opening the Post class broke jpa, Had not used jpa so tried to get that to work
Had not used spring injection so tried to get that to work with mapstruct

found out I had to add annotation processor in gradle, that was new
found out I had to use kapt or ksp
found out ksp does not work woth mapstruct
made mapstruct work with kapt

in the end had to rename the field in PostResponse

after the rename modelMapper also works

I noticed validation stuff return status code 500
Then I noticed we are using an old version of spring

Tried to upgrade everything, had to upgrade configuration
Tried to upgrade hibernate v6, but everything broke

Found out putting request params in a class made spring use status code 400 instead
